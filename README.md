# Organizational Application

## An app to organize your entire day!

This application aims to plan out your day. It will feature:

- Calendar
- Schedule
- To-do list on schedule
- Reminders
- Notifications and alarms for schedule and reminders
- (Maybe) Presets to allow for easy setup

This app is targeted towards students, but there will be functions that can be used for other people.

During online school, it has been very difficult to keep track of what homework I have, 
and the different times of all my classes. Compounded with the fact that many classes use
different websites to teach, it is very easy to miss an assignment or lecture.
